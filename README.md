# FurryFriendCare
My Project FurryFriendCare is an innovative platform who addresses the need of pet owners who may find themselves in a situation where they want to go outside but they can't take their beloved pets with them. My Project is a bridge between pet owner and care-taker, so that pet owner can find trusted care-taker nearby.
